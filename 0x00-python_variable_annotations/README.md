## Introduction

The Python Annotations Project is designed to help developers understand and practice Python annotations effectively. It includes annotated code examples, explanations, and guidelines for using annotations in Python.

## Installation

You can clone this repository and explore the annotated Python scripts directly. No additional installation is required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-annotations-project.git
cd python-annotations-project


## Usage
Explore the Python scripts and examples provided in this repository to learn about Python annotations. Each script includes comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and usage of annotations.



# Example code with annotations
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the sum of two integers.

    Parameters:
    - a (int): The first integer.
    - b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the two integers.
    """
    return a + b
